# zombie-chicken-attack-mobile
This was the first game I made in Unity. 
Only a few months before this, I was learning to use basic loops in C#.
The code here is definitely not a good example of clean and clear coding,
but I keep it as an example of how not knowing very sophisticated conventions or techniques,
I used sheer determination to make a working mobile game.

If I were to remake this game from scratch now, it could be done in half the lines.
It holds sentimental value to me, and sometimes I like to play it while waiting for a train.
